\Large{How can we make party supplies more accessible during night times, using the benefits of an easy-to-use ordering website and fast delivery service, and therefore provide an awesome party experience in Copenhagen and greater Copenhagen area?}
\SlimHRule\\[0.1cm]
\vspace{1em}
\end{center}

The above problem formulation focuses on a common problem among mostly younger people in today's society. During night times, most shops in Copenhagen are closed and bars are either too far away or too expensive, or both. Furthermore, most parties happen at private locations like apartments, where you can easily run out of supplies or you are simply too lazy to go to a shop and buy said supplies. This is where our service steps in. We provide a fast, reliable and secure service to deliver a broad variety of party supplies directly to the customer's doorstep. We make sure, the party never stops! 
\\ \\
Our product includes an easy ordering procedure through our website and a fast delivery by one of our employees. The supplies offered on our website are from a wide variety. We offer alcoholic beverages ranging from domestic and foreign beer to wine, vodka, whiskey and more, but also non-alcoholic beverages like coke (not the drug) and energy drinks. Furthermore, we are offering a great amount of party games like beer pong, card games, beer bongs and more. Alongside all of this, we also offer snacks and cigarettes. Special bundles for events like the \emph{Oktoberfest} are also included in our service.
\\ \\
Our target audience is mainly younger generations since they have the highest quantity of parties and also drink a lot more alcohol than older generations. We are hoping to especially appeal this audience with our variety of party games and special bundles. Nonetheless, anyone above the legal age is of course more than welcome to use our service.

\section{Empirical data}

%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{State of the art}

\subsubsection{Saucey \cite{Saucey}}
The website is for American citizens. It has a high-quality desktop interface including persuasive photos with drinking girls. It also has a high-quality logo, which defines their brand better.

Once you enter the main page, there is a button on "How it works" that sends you down the page, then it informs you that they have the best selection of wine, spirits and mixers. They also accentuate the fast delivery and the possibility of tracking your order with a simple click.

They feature some authoritative websites like the Los Angeles Times, Forbes and others. This is for building trust.

Further down the page, they display some testimonials of people who "love them", again, for making the customer to trust their service.

Furthermore, the website leads your journey through the website through positioning the "Get Started" button in the centre of the page along with a Zip Code or Address Field, making it easy for the customer to start his buying journey.

After you enter an address (for example, New York City) a grid-style based page appears with all the drinks available.

In this moment you can clearly see they intent to capture your attention in every possible manner, as you can find the top-right of each drink photo if a promotion is available.

Just below the main bar of the website, they display a search bar which searches for the input you type in (for example "wine" or "absolut vodka").

The overall appearance of the website, including the photos and the words used are quite persuasive, making sure, their service is the fastest possible, and they also try to appeal to the teenager customer by using words like "ASAP" or other slang used mainly by 18-25-year-old people.

The way they try to differentiate from the average alcohol delivery service is by offering a "book a bartender" option, if you really want to organise a big party.

\subsubsection{alkoXpress \cite{alkoXpress}}
This website is for Danish citizens in the northerly region of Zealand and they got a desktop interface which is easy to use. The design of the website is pretty simple as well. The usage of pictures and effects are minimized. At the top of the website, they have different kinds of “bars” which let you choose what drink you want. For example, the first bar is “Pakker” or “Package”. This will send you to a new page, where you can see all the different packages. 
\\ \\
Beyond alcohol, you can also buy cigarettes and accessories. The accessories are chips, cups and shot glasses etc. The order system is basic and easy to use, and if you have any kind of coupons to the website you can get some percentages off the price. 
Every drink is described when you click on them, for example, the Verdi Pomegranate 
“Gentle - sparkling - seductive - Italian.
Fresh with a comfortable well-balanced sweetness and a clean and light taste of pomegranate.
A beautiful sparkling tin based on natural ingredients.
Verdi Sparkletini is gluten-free”.
\\ \\
The package system is the way they try to differentiate from other alcohol delivery websites in Denmark. The audience of this website is younger people because of the names they use on the packages, such like “The King” “The Mexican” and “Beer pong”. 
\subsubsection{Allo Apéro Night \cite{alloAperoNight}}
The website offers service for french people located in Paris and greater Paris.
It’s purpose is very simple, delivering alcohol and drinks from 8pm to 6am.
The layout of the website is really simple and clean. They display a catalogue, which is very interactive, directly on the main page. They offer different kinds of alcohol, but also salads, accessories and soft drinks. 
\\ \\
The website has a dark themed vibe, that gives the users a sensation of premium services.
On the other hand, the lower part of the website is not well designed it and needs further polishing.
Their products are displayed in different categories such as beer, vodka, champagne, vine and so on.
When you click on one of them, you can see which brands they offer and there is a little description of the product.
The buying process is very generic. It’s the usual e-basket system, where you add your goods to the basket and then you have two options: either continue shopping or buy the goods.
\\ \\

You can also apply promotion codes.
The logo is very  simple, they have a catch phrase, which is that they deliver in 30 minutes maximum and their main emblem is the Eiffel tower.
Their consumer base is pretty large, ranging from 18 to 50 years of age, since shops close very early in Paris and there is no 24h super market.

\subsection{Analysis of external factors (PEST)} \label{PEST}

Since the delivery service is only offered in Copenhagen, this analysis solely focuses on the Danish factors in politics, economy and society.

\subsubsection{Political factors}
\subsubsection{Economic factors}
The danish economy is the 35th largest national economy, according to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the United Nations \cite{PEST_NominalGDP}. It is also ranked 8th in the nominal GDP per capita rankings \cite{PEST_GDPperCapita}.

\subsection{Stakeholder analysis} \label{StakeholderAnalysis}

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{pics/stakeholder.png}\\
As seen in the diagram, we have prioritized our stakeholders in our project by influence and interest. In order to get most successful way to mantain a perfect work atmosphere, we need to provide every specific stakeholder with specific information. For each stakeholder we made the following information: 

\textbf{SKAT:}
In order to have our project/e-shop successful, we need to avoid problems with SKAT, because they have the influence to shut us down. The solution to fulfill their interest and prevent SKAT to shut us down we need to always use an account that always will make a track for our income and taxes, and also, the account should use an SKAT-consultant if the person has some questions.

\textbf{Government:}
Governement has a high influence on our shop, as being an Alcohol selling e-shop, that could cause some problems if we get their non-wanted attention to us. Some of these things could be expired alcohol license, over-selling alcohol, selling alcohol to minors etc. Of course, we will follow all the laws and additional rules, but just in case, we will have put an extra effort while making deliveries or accounting the money.

\textbf{Competitors:}
Competitors are very important to every company, because the more you know competitors, we get better in an enrolled and unofficial competition with each other and also a better stability in the industry.

\textbf{Suppliers:}
Suppliers are the key value in our project, because if we have problems with them, we will have no products to sell in our e-shop. Therefore, we need to have a perfect relationship with them. The best way to get that is to follow the rules engaged by them and/or contract made between us. Also, follow an extra attention to thing as: Payment deadline, Missing information, Ignoring their warning, etc.

\textbf{Owners:}
Owners should have the closest managing attitude, because the consequences could lead to the termination of the project. In order to fulfill owners desired, the tasks and directions made by them should be followed by the employees, should be advised by promoters and web-content manager, and avoid errors at work by accountant and delivery-men.

\textbf{Promoters:}
Promoters have a very important role in our project, because if we don't promote our e-shop, there will be no sales, therefore no customers and no money. To help promoters do their job good, we need to provide them with no pressure, resources, information and other neccessary things that they require.

\textbf{Web-content manager:}
Web-content manager is the face of our e-shop, as all the content, all the products are edited/made by him, and afterwards sold to the customers. We should provide him with required resources as: full information on products, full information on the company(that is shown to the customers on the website), all the new strategies of promoting(therefore he can change the packages/products on the website).

\textbf{Accountant:}
Accountant is the person that keeps the track of all the income, money used for resources, money used for law-purposes(such as consultants, licenses etc.), taxes. The most important thing that will keep her satisfied is that everybody makes all the money go through her, and of course, that will avoid any law problems in the future.

\textbf{Delivery-men:}
Delivery-men will be the people deliver our stuff to the customers, therefore if he fails to deliver different orders, we either will have a lot of complaints to our e-shop, or we will have no customers at all. To avoid this, we need to provide specific trainings, resources(electric-mopeds, warm-suits for winter etc.), and a decent salary wage.
